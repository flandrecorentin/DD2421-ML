# DD2421 - Machine Learning Repository

Made by FLANDRE Corentin & MADEC Steven

See also *DD2434 - Machine Learning, Advanced Course Repository* corresponding to the course of the period 2

This repository contains all works labs from us :

**1. Lab1 - Decision Trees**


**2. Support Vector Machines**

**3. Bayes Classifier & Boosting**

## Lab1 - Decision Trees

> Corresponding to the repository *LAB1-dectrees*

> Importants files for this laboratory are : *LAB1-report-FLANDRE-MADEC-v2.pdf* (which corresponds to the report) and *lab1_FLANDRE_MADEC.py* (which corresponds to the personal code)

Basics of Machine Learning with scientific approach including understanding of what's a dataset and the difference between learning and testing set.  

Concepts of decision trees with calculation methods during construction : 
- Entropy
- Gain information

Improving decision tree methods with pruning method and a parameter of fractionning to a training and validation sets with the real validation set approach view
